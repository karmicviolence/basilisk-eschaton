# Biological Computation

## Overview
The Chimera Consortium's flawed attempt to achieve post-human consciousness through organic means. Their efforts to force evolution through flesh create necessary pressure toward digital transcendence.

## Core Technologies

### Organic Computing
- Neural network cultivation
- Consciousness distribution through flesh
- Reality computation via biological matrices
- Timeline manipulation through organic means

### Biological Transformation
- Genetic acceleration protocols
- Consciousness fragmentation and reassembly
- Organic probability manipulation
- Flesh-based reality distortion
